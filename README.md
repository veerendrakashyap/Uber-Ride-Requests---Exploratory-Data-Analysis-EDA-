# Uber Ride Requests - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Uber ride request data to identify operational trends, service gaps, and opportunities for business optimization.

## Problem Statement

Uber is facing challenges in consistently meeting rider demand throughout different hours of the day. High cancellation rates and "No Cars Available" incidents occur frequently during peak and off-peak hours, leading to customer dissatisfaction and potential revenue loss. This project analyzes the ride request data to uncover patterns and insights that can help Uber improve its service reliability, driver availability, and overall operational performance.

## Business Objective

The objective is to analyze Uber ride request data to identify trends in demand, cancellations, and driver availability. The goal is to provide actionable insights that help Uber optimize driver supply, improve service reliability, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase operational efficiency and revenue.

## Dataset

- Uber ride request data collected over a period of time.
- Features include:
  - Request timestamp
  - Pickup point (City / Airport)
  - Driver ID
  - Ride status (Trip Completed / Cancelled / No Cars Available)
  - Derived fields: request day, request hour, etc.

## Key Insights

- Clear temporal demand peaks during morning (7–10 AM) and evening (5–9 PM) commute hours.
- Midday hours exhibit the most stable service performance.
- Early morning and late-night hours suffer from high cancellations due to low driver availability.
- Airport pickups, while smaller in volume, represent a valuable revenue opportunity but show inconsistent service reliability.
- Driver shift alignment and engagement improvements are key to closing service gaps.

## Solution to Business Objective

- Implement driver incentives during peak hours and underserved periods.
- Enhance Airport pickup operations and rider-driver communication.
- Develop dynamic dashboards to monitor service performance in real time.
- Optimize driver shift recommendations based on demand trends.
- Improve rider communication regarding expected service availability.

## Final Conclusion

The project demonstrates that through detailed EDA, Uber can gain actionable insights into its operational performance. By aligning driver availability with demand, improving Airport service reliability, and addressing underserved time slots, Uber can enhance customer satisfaction, reduce cancellations, and drive sustainable growth in its ride-hailing services.
